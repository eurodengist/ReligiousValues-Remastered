<h2>What is ReligiousValues Remastered?</h2>
    <p>ReligiousValues Remastered, based off of <a href="https://bannnedb.github.io/Religious-values-test/">Religious Values Test</a> is a religious quiz that attempts to assign percentages on ten different religious axes. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!</p>
